        <p>I was at work when I heard some person in Everett had been diagnosed with SARS C0V-2. 
            Actually, I was working in Everett when I heard this. I thought it was mildly interesting adn not at all alarming. 
            Just another way for the media to gain some viewership. This will blow over in a week. 
            I have to admit, those first couple weeks I would scoff at anyone I sw waering gloves or a mask.
            That was February 2020. One month later, cases had popped up almost in every state, and people were starting to get concerend.

            Fast-forward to early April 2020. Governer Jay Inslee of Washington has issued a shelter-in-place order for residents.
